This file is a guide for how to render the Sokoban game and use the Sokoban solver.

Step 1. Install pygame.

Step 2. Place your level file in the pySokoban/levels/test directory. You can see some examples in the pySokoban/levels/ directory.

Step 3. Run your algorithm and place the solution in a file belonging to the pySokoban/levels/solver drirectory. The content of the file should be a string of characters, representing the player's moves. You can see some examples in the pySokoban/levels/solver directory.

**Note**: The file name should be levelX, where X is the level number you want to solve. The level number should match the level file in the pySokoban/levels/test directory.

Step 4. Run the sokoban.py file in the pySokoban directory and see the result. 

**Note**: You can change this workflow by making changes to the pySokoban/sokoban.py file.
